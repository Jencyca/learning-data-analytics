# Learning Data Analytics

This repository documents my structured learning journey in data analytics.

I am currently building a strong foundation in:
- Python for Data Analysis (Pandas)
- SQL for data querying and analysis

The repository will be updated regularly with hands-on practice notebooks
and small exercises as I progress and strengthen my analytical skills.
