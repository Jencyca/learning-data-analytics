# Learning Data Analytics

This repository documents my structured learning journey in data analytics.

I am currently building a strong foundation in:
- Python for Data Analysis (Pandas)
- SQL for data querying and analysis

## Daily Progress

- Day 1: Learned SQL basics (SELECT, WHERE) and Pandas DataFrame fundamentals.
- Day 2: Practiced SQL filtering, sorting and joins. Applied Pandas concepts on my own dataset and explored data structure.
- Day 3: Practiced types of joins and expressions. Learned how to handle missing values in python.
